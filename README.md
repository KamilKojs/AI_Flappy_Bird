# Overview
This is the code for the "AI_Flappy_Bird" app written in Java. Gui was built in Java Swing. The app uses custom Neural Network and Matrix library built from scratch. These libraries are not optimised well to do complex math operations. The point of building them myself was to understand inside out how neural networks work.
Bu building the app I learned about the concept of Neuroevolution and Genetic Algorithms.
